# Content Strategy & SEO Plan

## Strategic Positioning

**Target Audience**: Pakistani students aged 21-30 preparing for CSS examination
**Content Voice**: Authoritative, practical, encouraging—like a senior who cleared CSS advising a junior
**Differentiation**: Research-backed, data-driven, comprehensive—not generic guidebook content

## Content Principles

### 1. Every Page Must Have

- **Clear H1** matching primary keyword
- **Meta description** with keyword and value proposition
- **Scannable structure** with H2/H3 hierarchy
- **Actionable takeaways** (not just information dumps)
- **Internal links** to 3-5 related pages
- **Data/statistics** where applicable
- **Source attribution** for credibility

### 2. Content Depth Guidelines

| Page Type | Word Count | Sections | Data Points |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Hub page | 1500-2000 | 5-7 | 5+ |
| Subject page | 2000-3000 | 8-10 | 10+ |
| Guide page | 2500-4000 | 10-12 | 8+ |
| Reference page | 1000-1500 | 4-6 | 3+ |

### 3. Trust Signals

Every page should include where relevant:
- FPSC as primary source
- Specific years for data (e.g., "CSS 2024 results")
- Book author names, not just titles
- Topper strategies attributed to specific batches
- Links to official resources
