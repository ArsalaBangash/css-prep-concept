1. **Source attribution**: "According to FPSC..." or "Based on 2024 results..."
2. **Specificity**: Year-specific data, not generic claims
3. **Actionability**: What should the reader DO with this information?
4. **Internal links**: Connect to related content
5. **Scannable**: Headers, bullets, tables—not walls of text
