## Purpose

This site aims to be **Pakistan's most comprehensive CSS exam information repository**, attracting organic traffic through authoritative, well-structured content.

## Core Principles

1. **Information-First**: Not an app, not a platform—a definitive resource
2. **SEO-Driven**: Every page targets specific search intent
3. **Authority Building**: Depth over breadth; expert-level content
4. **User Journey**: Clear paths from discovery to deep engagement

## Document Index

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `roadmap.md` | Master project phases and timeline |
| `content-strategy.md` | SEO priorities, keyword targeting, content hierarchy |
| `content-specs.md` | Detailed specifications for each new page/section |
| `information-architecture.md` | Site structure, navigation, internal linking |
| `content-inventory.md` | Gap analysis: current state vs. target state |

## For Sub-Agents

Each document contains self-contained briefs that can be executed independently. Look for sections marked with `## TASK:` headers—these are discrete work packages.

**Template Reference**: Use `/pages/subjects/international-relations.vue` as the template for new subject pages. It contains the standard structure: SEO meta, subject meta object, syllabus arrays, books array, online resources, common mistakes, scoring history, and full template markup.
